# 75-Hard-for-Programmers-Student-Athlete-Edition
This challenge is a tailored version of the popular "75 Hard" program, designed for individuals balancing a busy schedule as students, athletes, and workers. The goal is to develop discipline, consistency, and growth in programming skills without compromising other priorities.

75 Hard for Programmers (Student-Athlete Edition)
Code for 1 Hour Daily (Minimum):
Dedicate at least 1 focused hour each day to coding or improving your programming skills.

Learn or Practice One New Thing:
Focus on understanding or practicing one new programming concept, tool, or feature daily.

Solve One Coding Problem (3-5 Days a Week):
Tackle a coding problem on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank. Aim for consistency, but allow flexibility for your busy days.

Work on a Project (At Least 3 Times a Week):
Make meaningful progress on a personal project or contribute to an open-source project.

Read 5 Pages or Watch a Tutorial (Daily):
Read from a programming book, online guide, or watch a short, focused tutorial.

Document Your Progress Weekly:
Reflect on what you've learned each week in a journal or blog (even just a bullet-point list).

Prioritize Rest and Recovery:
Stick to a sustainable work-life balance. If a day is packed, ensure you do something small to avoid burnout.

Limit Social Media to 30 Minutes/Day:
Unless it’s related to learning or networking, keep non-productive social media use in check.

Flexibility: If your schedule is exceptionally tight, aim for 5-6 days a week of full participation instead of 7, and don’t stress over perfection.
